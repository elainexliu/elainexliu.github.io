## Side quests

- Doing side quests have created some of the best, most serendipitous moments of my life
-- improv, half marathon, 

- Doing side quests allows you to lower the stakes--which is good for action
- Don't worry about whether something is a side or main quest. all of it is your quest so long as you have a north star of some kind.

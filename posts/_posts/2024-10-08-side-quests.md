## A few pieces of advice from One Piece

### from luffy:

- Cares about the people around him (genuinely wants the best for them, rekindles their dreams and inspires them (often when his own confidence in himself))
- Relentless in the pursuit of his goal
- Has ridiculously strong self belief and confidence
- Doesn't take things too seriously until he does (when something morally wrong happens or his friends are involved)
- Makes people feel important and needed
- Willing to fail over and over again and is willing to accept that
- Super curious and joyful
- Extremely altruistic (re: selfish in building, selfless in distribution(?))
- Judges people on their characteristics and values but gives people second chances
- Has a sense of shameless sincerity

And I've seen these traits in other leaders I admire too (irl)

## Growing up and getting older

Revelations that I always knew of, but only recently actually processed:
- Everyone, no matter their age, was once a child. At one point, they daydreamed, set seemingly impossible goals, had frustrations of dealing with adults, laughed without having experienced much of the world. The feeling of processing this revelation is very very abstract, but it feels weirdly familiar to now see a grandma walking down the streets of Taiwan and see someone who was running around like my friends and I do now.
- I am getting older. Not feeling scared about it, just feeling excited, anxious, and a little bit sad that I can never experience my past experiences again. But on to new things.

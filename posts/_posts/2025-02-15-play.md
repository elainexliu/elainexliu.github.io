## The loss of play in adulthood

We can all benefit from more whimsy in our lives.

This past year, I've spent a good portion of my two semesters trying to maximize whimsy experiences--through improv and making a fool of myself in front of hundreds of my classmates, frollicking with friends and laying on sunny turf, taking a bodies in motion class, and other fun, silly, laugh-til-your-stomach-hurts experiences with friends.

I realized, the work will get done. Things always work out. But the whimsy won't always be here. I've found that finding the joy now makes life so much brighter, so I'll be keeping this up.

Go run, frollick, heel-click, dance, or whatever you need to do to feel the sense of play we felt when we were young at recess.

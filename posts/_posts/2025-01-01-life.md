1. good things come to those who wait (wait = are able to understand long term gratification and hard work.)
2. don't try to people please. in any sense of the word. be yourself. don't try to tell people you'll be there in 5 to make them feel better in the moment when you know you'll take 15. just say you'll take 15.
3. whenever you feel that knot in your chest/plexis, take a deep breath. it'll be fine.
4. choose the hard you want
5. doing the thing will never take that long. just do it now.
6. ask the dumb questions
7. follow your heart because this is the one life we live.

Things that give me energy:
- meeting incredibly cool people and chatting with them about the things we care about
- thinking about the bigger picture of things and why they matter
- watching nature


Thinking on these things:
- strengths (juhi convo)

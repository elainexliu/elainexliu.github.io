1. good things come to those who wait (wait = are able to understand long term gratification and hard work.)
2. don't try to people please. in any sense of the word. be yourself. don't try to tell people you'll be there in 5 to make them feel better in the moment when you know you'll take 15. just say you'll take 15.
3. whenever you feel that knot in your chest/plexis, take a deep breath. it'll be fine.
4. choose the hard you want
5. doing the thing will never take that long. just do it now.
6. ask the dumb questions
7. follow your heart because this is the one life we live.
8. it's all just about truth seeking. not optics, not posturing, just working towards the truth and being curious.
9. there's always a lesson learned.
10. find your strengths. utilize those. make them converge with things your interested in if needed.

Things that give me energy:
- meeting incredibly cool people and chatting with them about the things we care about
- thinking about the bigger picture of things and why they matter
- watching nature
- learning about things i didn't know about before
- improv

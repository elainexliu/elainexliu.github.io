This was my senior capstone project for senior engineering course. It is a carbon monoxide sensor that shines different colors of light depending on the concentration of carbon monoxide around it. Inspired by a Chinese  lantern, it has designs of a dragon (playing on the concept of deng, meaning light, and long, meaning dragon, to create deng long, meaning lantern). I really enjoyed the process of making the project. Here's a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE9UoMy6GXo">video</a> of it working, and you can check out the documentation of it <a href="https://sites.google.com/charlottelatin.org/elaineliudigitalportfolio/senior-year/senior-engineering-project?authuser=0">here</a>.

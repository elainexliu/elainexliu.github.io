## cUSD: a conformable ultrasound device

For the past year, I've been working with the MIT Media Lab Conformable Decoders group on ultrasound controlled drug delivery systems.

We're looking at ways of using sonophoresis for small-molecule drug delivery. We were looking at cosmeceutical applications before, but we've pivoted since. I've worked on characterizing piezoelectric transducer behavior based on relative location, researching new sonophoresis applications, and now building the piezoelectric driver for the system itself for the past semester.

It's been a really exciting ride so far. I've learned so much from my grad student mentors and Lab Director, and have become a better engineer because of them.

#### Building the piezodriver

There were a few phases of prototyping this driver. Our overall goal was to design a driver that we could program to sweep around the resonant frequencies of the piezos---this way, we can continuously update resonance and ensure that maximum efficiency of the drug delivery. 

The circuit consists of 3 main parts: an H-bridge, an LC filter, and the piezo. To check resonance, we add a current sense resistor next to the piezo. Here's the schematic I made on LTSpice:

Before we tested the circuit with the H-bridge, we wanted to confirm that the current sense resistor portion was working as expected. We breadboarded the differential op amp and RC LPF for testing with a power supply and scope first. I worked with another classmate on breadboarding and testing, asking our grad student mentor about any hardware bugs we were facing that we couldn't solve ourselves.

We ultimately saw expected behavior and went on to combine the differential op amp circuit with the H-bridge.

#### The code

As we worked on the electronics, I would spend time outside the lab on the programming and controls portion with MPLAB X IDE and C.

After discussing with my grad student mentor on the structure of the code, we decided that the overall functionality would have two modes: scanning and pulsing. 

In the scanning mode, we systematically test different frequencies around a center frequency (starting at 206kHz), take measurements of current at each frequency using ADC, scan frequencies in both directions (Â±10kHz from center by default, in 1kHz steps), then store current measurements in an array for analysis.

The pulsing mode activates after completing a scan to give time to update the resonant frequency. We turn the output on and off with 50ms intervals, set the Complementary Waveform Generator (CWG) to disable output, and stay for a defined period.

The basic operation flow:
- System starts in SCANNING mode
- Tests 21 different frequencies (10 below center, center, 10 above)
- For each frequency: Sets NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) to generate the test frequency, measure the current response, and store result in array
- After collecting all measurements, I wrote a function called evalArray() to analyze the data to find the resonant peak
- Updates the center frequency if a resonant peak is found
- Switches to PULSING mode for the specified period
- Cycle repeats

More on the evalArray() function: it looks for three possible patterns in the current measurements:
- Peak in middle (increasing then decreasing)
- Decreasing (peak at start)
- Increasing (peak at end)
to help track and maintain operation at the resonant frequency, which can shift over time due to temperature or other factors.

## cUSD: a conformable ultrasound device

For the past year, I've been working with the MIT Media Lab Conformable Decoders group on ultrasound controlled drug delivery systems.

We're looking at ways of using sonophoresis for small-molecule drug delivery. We were looking at cosmeceutical applications before, but we've pivoted since. I've worked on characterizing piezoelectric transducer behavior based on relative location, researching new sonophoresis applications, and now building the piezoelectric driver for the system itself.

It's been a really exciting ride so far. I've learned so much from my grad student mentors and Lab Director, and have become a better engineer because of them.

#### Characterizing piezoelectric transducer behavior


#### Building the piezodriver

There were a few phases of prototyping this driver. Our overall goal was to design a driver that we could program to sweep around the resonant frequencies of the piezos---this way, we can continuously update resonance and ensure that maximum efficiency of the drug delivery. 

The circuit consists of 3 main parts: an H-bridge, an LC filter, and the piezo. To check resonance, we add a current sense resistor next to the piezo. Here's the schematic I made on LTSpice:

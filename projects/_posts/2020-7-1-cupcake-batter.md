## cupcake: an automatic cupcake batter dispenser
#### because who has time to make cupcakes nowadays?

Cupcake is a project I made with a team of 6 others for our Week 17 project of Fab Academy. We had to build a machine. We liked eating. We liked cupcakes. And so cupcake was born.

I worked heavily on the design of this project. Here are some sketches and designs:

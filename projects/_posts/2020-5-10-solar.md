#### an interactive light "piano."

I wanted to get out of my comfort zone for the final project of my first ever engineering class. I explored capacitive sensing in this project to design a circular light "piano" that lights up depending on the sensor you press.

### ideas

When I started looking for final project ideas, I knew I wanted to utilize capacitive touch to prepare for my final FabAcademy project. My first idea was a capacitive touch and conductive fabric plush game controller, but I knew that I wasn't fully interested in the project. I also worried that using conductive fabric would not teach me as much about capacitive touch as other projects could. I was excited by the project in that it would let me make a game controller to play the games that I love in a new and different way. My second idea was a capacitive touch Arduino piano keyboard. My worries with this project was that it was too simple, and that it would not be challenging enough for me. However, I was excited that making the project would allow me to make a version of an instrument that was so special to me. My third idea was an capacitive touch LED and MIDI circular-piano project, named Eclipse. My worries with this project was that it would take too long for me to make, and that I would not be able to code the LED string lights and the MIDI, but I wanted to take up on the challenge. I was most excited to make this project because it would give me an opportunity to take on a new challenge of making a relatively complex project that I had never experienced before. I expected that the most challenging part of the project would be implementing the capacitive sensors.

I chose my third idea, the Eclipse project, because it seemed like a really interesting project with the sleekest design out of the three projects. I also thought that the project would teach me a lot about capacitive sensors and how to use them. For me, a successful project would uniquely light up depending on which capacitive sensor was pressed. I used the Instructables project version, made by user jbumstead (which can be found at https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Eclipse-With-Touch-Sensors-and-MIDI/), as inspiration and reference.

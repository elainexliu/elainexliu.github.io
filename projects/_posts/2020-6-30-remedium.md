## remedium
#### a web app that helps improve treatment outcomes for chemotherapy patients.

This is a web app startup I made in a team of 5 at the MIT LaunchX summer camp. We went through the entire process of beginning a startupâ€“I was a "Builder" on the team, designing the wireframes of the app, designing it, and prototyping it. Remedium is a web app that allows users to track chemotherapy side effect data and communicate it with doctors.

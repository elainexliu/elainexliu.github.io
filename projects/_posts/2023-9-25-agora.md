## agora: a speech emotion-recognition decision-making web app
#### can't make a decision? it's time to go with your gut.

People always say, "just go with your gut." But sometimes, it's hard for us to listen to what our guts are truly saying.

Two friends and I wanted to make something that would make it easier to really know what we wanted. And thus, Agora was born.

Agora is a web app we developed during HackMIT 2023. I built the backend powered by a Python sentiment analysis model sourced from Hugging Face and developed the main decision-making functionality of the web app. Agora creates a positive and negative gut feeling score based on the magnitude of various emotions detected in a .wav file uploaded by the user. We tell you the decision you actually want to make based on a calculation of those scores.

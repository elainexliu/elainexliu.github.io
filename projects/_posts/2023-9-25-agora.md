## agora: a speech emotion-recognition decision-making web app
#### can't make a decision? it's time to go with your gut.

People always say, "just go with your gut." But sometimes, we don't know what our gut actually wants. I sometimes wish that there was something that would tell me what I actually wanted.

Agora is a web app I developed with my team of 3 during HackMIT 2023. I built the backend with a speech emotion recognition Hugging Face Inference API and developed the main decision-making functionality of the web app. Based on the magnitude of various emotions detected in a .wav file uploaded by the user, agora creates a positive and negative gut feeling score. We tell you the decision you actually want to make based on a calculation of those scores.

See a video we made for it <a href = "https://youtube.com/watch?v=fxhFVNplBYM">here</a>, and find the repo <a href = "https://github.com/elaineliuwang/agora_hackMIT">here</a>.

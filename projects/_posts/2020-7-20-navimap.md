This is my capstone project for Fab Academy. So many late nights went into this project, and I loved the way it turned out. Navimap is an interactive, continent-naming touch map that allows the user to look at pictures of my high school's sister schools across the globe on a separate interface. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFzklkM2qlE">this video</a> to see the parts that go into it and a clip of it working, and check out the <a href = "http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/charlotte/students/elaine-liu/projects/final-project/">original documentation</a>.

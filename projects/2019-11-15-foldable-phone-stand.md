## foldable phone stand
#### look at your phone the way you want.

This was the first project that made me stay in the lab until late evenings (I chose to do it on own though so it was self-inflicted fun). I wanted to make a fun adjustable foldable phone stand, so I did! I had previously used a Popsocket as a phone stand, but I wanted to a) replace the Popsocket with a phone wallet for personal preference and b) be able to change the angle of the phone.

I designed everything on Fusion360. But back then I wasn't really adept at it, so even though I tried to make everything parameterized, changing the parameters doesn't really work too well. (This sucked when I left it at school one time and ended up losing it after bringing it with me and using everywhere; I couldn't recreate it that easily because I was too lazy to post-process everything again.)

I'm a student at MIT studying EECS from Charlotte, NC.

I'm passionate about doing cool things that make people feel good. Specifically, I'm interested in IoT/embedded systems, AI/computer vision, wearables, and BCI for health and consumer applications. I also love improv, art, ethics, political philosophy, and [other stuff](https://elainexliu.github.io/writing.html).

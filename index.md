Hi! I'm a second-year undergrad at MIT studying EECS from Charlotte, NC.

I'm interested in tech (IoT, AI/ML/CV, MEMS) solutions for health and safety applications. I'm also curious about how ethics and political philosophy guide the way we think about and navigate technology and entrepreneurship.

some thoughts
I tend to overthink often; writing lets me get some of those thoughts off my mind. here's my little attic library

for fun
In my free time, I'm the biggest fan of sunsets and love to oil paint and sketch! Trying to do more digital art too. Also love lifting, going to cafes, and strolling around in libraries.

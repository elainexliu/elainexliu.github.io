I'm a student at MIT studying EECS from Charlotte, NC.

I'm passionate about doing cool things that make people feel good. Specifically, I'm interested in IoT/embedded systems, AI/computer vision, wearables, and BCI for health and consumer applications. I also love think a lot about ethics, political philosophy, playgrounds (or the lack thereof for adults), and [other stuff](https://elainexliu.github.io/writing.html).

## now

- Scheming and Brewing in health
- Researching conformable drug delivery methods @ Conformable Decoders in the Media Lab
- Venture Partner at Contrary

## previously

- Thrive Fellow (GTM strategy, cash burn modeling, and investing for health and consumer tech and BCIs at Thrive)
- Schemed at Prod
- Optimized vehicle computer vision models at VIA + explored Taiwan
- Controlled drug delivery methods + bioMEMS research at the MIT Koch Institute
- Made fire alarm detection products and IoT data management systems at Enventys Partners
- Predicted hereditary cataracts with ML research at UNC Wilmington
- Learned [how to make almost anything](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/charlotte/students/elaine-liu/) at FabAcademy
- Introduced engineering and reframed the field to a new wave of amazing young girls at sheMakes

## side quests

I love sunsets, [oil painting, and sketching](https://www.instagram.com/elaineliuart/). Also love skating (with skateboards), lifting, [improv](https://www.instagram.com/roadkillbuffet/) and laughing, and strolling around in libraries[.](/m-port)

## some thoughts

I tend to overthink often; writing lets me get some of those thoughts off my mind. Here's my little basement library:

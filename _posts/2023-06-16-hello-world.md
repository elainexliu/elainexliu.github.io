##Hello World!

Hey! I've been wanting to write more for a while now, and writing in my journal has proven to take a long time for each entry. I've also been telling myself that I'd rework my personal website. So here we are! killing two birds with one stone. Or one repo in this case.

Look forward to plenty of brain dumps going forward. My friends know quite well that I am one to overthink, so I'll be needing this as an outlet. See you soon.
